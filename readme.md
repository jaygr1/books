My program can be run by navigating into the lib folder and running score.rb.

I spent about 3 hours building the program, the max of the time box. I hit a bit of a snag parsing the csv file initially, so I wasn't able to fully complete the exercise.  If there was more time, I would first get the program working properly and then add a better fuzzy search feature.  After that, some serious refactoring would be in order.  My methods are too long and don't have great separation of concerns.
